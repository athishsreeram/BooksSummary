# Thinking, Fast and Slow – Key Words and Concepts

Below is a list of key words and concepts from *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman, a seminal book that explores the dual-process theory of the mind and how we make decisions. These terms reflect the core ideas Kahneman presents about human cognition, biases, and reasoning:

## Key Words and Concepts

- **System 1** – Fast, automatic, intuitive thinking.  
- **System 2** – Slow, deliberate, analytical thinking.  
- **Cognitive Bias** – Systematic errors in thinking that affect decisions.  
- **Heuristics** – Mental shortcuts used by System 1 to simplify judgments.  
- **Availability** – Judging likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind.  
- **Anchoring** – Relying too heavily on initial information (the "anchor").  
- **Framing** – How the presentation of options influences choices.  
- **Loss Aversion** – Preferring to avoid losses over acquiring equivalent gains.  
- **Overconfidence** – Excessive belief in one’s own judgment or knowledge.  
- **Priming** – How exposure to one stimulus affects response to another.  
- **Prospect Theory** – A model of decision-making under risk, emphasizing losses and gains.  
- **Regression to the Mean** – Extreme outcomes tend to revert to average over time.  
- **Substitution** – Answering an easier question than the one posed.  
- **Confirmation Bias** – Seeking or interpreting evidence to support existing beliefs.  
- **Hindsight Bias** – Seeing past events as more predictable after they occur.  
- **Intuition** – Quick, gut-based judgments from System 1.  
- **Effort** – The mental labor required by System 2 to override System 1.  
- **Probability** – Misjudging odds due to cognitive distortions.  
- **Risk** – How people weigh uncertainty differently than logic predicts.  
- **Narrative Fallacy** – Creating stories to explain complex events.  
- **Base Rate** – Ignoring general statistics in favor of specific cases.  
- **Illusion of Validity** – Overestimating the accuracy of subjective judgments.  
- **WYSIATI** – "What You See Is All There Is": Acting on incomplete information.  
- **Halo Effect** – Letting one trait influence overall perception.  
- **Rationality** – The tension between intuitive and logical decision-making.
