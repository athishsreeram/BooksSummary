# Summary of *Atomic Habits*  

## Overview  
*Atomic Habits* by James Clear explores how small, consistent changes in behavior can lead to remarkable improvements in life. The book emphasizes the power of habits, focusing on the process rather than the goal, and provides a framework for building good habits while breaking bad ones.

## Key Concepts  

### Habits & Behavior  
- **Habits** – Small, repeated behaviors that shape your life.

- **Reward** – The benefit you gain, reinforcing the habit.  
- **Habit Loop** – The cycle of cue, craving, response, and reward.
