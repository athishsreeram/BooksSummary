# Thinking, Fast and Slow – Section-by-Section Key Words and Concepts

This is a section-by-section breakdown of key words and concepts from *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman. The book is divided into five parts, each focusing on a different aspect of how we think. The following summary captures the essence of each part and highlights the major concepts introduced.

---

## Part I: Two Systems

**Focus**: Introduces the dual-process theory of the mind—System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate)—and how they interact.

### Key Words and Concepts

- **System 1** – Automatic, effortless, emotional thinking.  
- **System 2** – Controlled, effortful, logical thinking.  
- **Cognitive Ease** – Tendency to favor familiar or easy-to-process information.  
- **Priming** – Subtle influences that shape subsequent thoughts or actions.  
- **Attention** – System 2’s limited capacity to focus and override System 1.  
- **Illusion of Remembering** – False confidence in memory due to fluency.  
- **Associative Memory** – How ideas link together in System 1.

## Part II: Heuristics and Biases

**Focus**: Explores how System 1 uses mental shortcuts (heuristics) that lead to biases and errors in judgment.

### Key Words and Concepts

- **Heuristics** – Quick rules of thumb for decision-making.  
- **Availability Heuristic** – Judging probability by ease of recall.  
- **Anchoring** – Over-relying on initial information as a reference point.  
- **Representativeness** – Judging based on stereotypes rather than statistics.  
- **Substitution** – Replacing a hard question with an easier one.  
- **Affect Heuristic** – Decisions swayed by emotions rather than facts.  
- **Base Rate Neglect** – Ignoring general probabilities for specific cases.

## Part III: Overconfidence

**Focus**: Examines how we overestimate our knowledge, skills, and predictions, often due to System 1’s overconfidence.

### Key Words and Concepts

- **Overconfidence** – Excessive trust in one’s own judgments.  
- **Illusion of Validity** – Believing subjective assessments are accurate.  
- **Hindsight Bias** – Seeing past events as more predictable after the fact.  
- **Narrative Fallacy** – Crafting coherent stories to explain random events.  
- **Expert Intuition** – When intuition is reliable (or not) in skilled domains.  
- **Regression to the Mean** – Misinterpreting natural fluctuations as trends.  
- **WYSIATI** – "What You See Is All There Is": Acting on limited data.

## Part IV: Choices

**Focus**: Introduces Prospect Theory and how people make decisions under risk and uncertainty, often irrationally.

### Key Words and Concepts

- **Prospect Theory** – Decision-making model based on perceived gains/losses.  
- **Loss Aversion** – Stronger dislike for losses than desire for gains.  
- **Framing** – How wording or context alters choices.  
- **Reference Point** – Baseline from which gains/losses are judged.  
- **Certainty Effect** – Overvaluing certain outcomes over probable ones.  
- **Endowment Effect** – Valuing something more once you own it.  
- **Risk Aversion** – Preferring safety over uncertain rewards.

## Part V: Two Selves

**Focus**: Contrasts the "experiencing self" (moment-to-moment feelings) with the "remembering self" (how we recall experiences), and their implications.

### Key Words and Concepts

- **Experiencing Self** – The self that lives in the present moment.  
- **Remembering Self** – The self that evaluates past experiences.  
- **Peak-End Rule** – Judging experiences by their peak and end, not duration.  
- **Duration Neglect** – Ignoring how long an experience lasts.  
- **Happiness** – Tension between immediate feelings and retrospective satisfaction.  
- **Utility** – How we measure pleasure or pain in decisions.  
- **Well-Being** – How memory distorts our sense of life quality.

## Final Notes

Each part builds on the previous one, weaving together psychology, behavioral economics, and real-world examples. These keywords are distilled from the main ideas in each section, reflecting Kahneman’s arguments about how our minds work and why we often deviate from rationality.
